# Simple-Regression-Neural-Network
A DNN model that proceeds the regression of simple function, which is named SRNN(Simple Regression Neural Network). 

This model is written in Python. TensorFlow or any Deep Learing framework WAS NOT USED. 
Libraries you need to compile this are Numpy, matplotlib, and scipy.

Optimizer is set to "Adam" basically, but changable to SGD. If you want to use other optimizers besides them, you can make it easily by modifying class structure. An optimizer class must have the update() method. 

I referred to "Deep Learning from Scratch".
